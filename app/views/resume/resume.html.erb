<h4><i class='fa fa-users'></i> EWU Senior Capstone Project â€“ Course Evaluator <a class="fa fa-lg fa-github" href= "https://github.com/sbozhinov/evals"> </a></h4>
<p>
Part of the team of 4 that worked on a web app (evals.compsci.ewu) that students use to evaluate
and give feedback about classes theyâ€™re enrolled in at the end of the quarter. The app includes admin side to manage users and data. Technologies used were: CodeIgniter MVC, EWU sign in (SSO), Bootstrap, MySql, Ajax/Jquery.
</p>
<p>I was working on views, design improvements, solved slow admin query issues (models/infoupload_model.php), modified error messages, some ajax to improve admin GUI. </p>

were consumed by the main program.</p>

<p>
The biggest project I had was updating cdacasino.com, given the designer's docs I've coded it using HTML,
PHP, SQL and JQuery. My version was live for about a year before another redesign. I Also Used WordPress to code a few other websites for clients.</p>
